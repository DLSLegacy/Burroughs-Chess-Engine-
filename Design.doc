# Burroughs-Chess-Engine- 

I'm developing a chess engine to help build my understanding of the tactics & strategy of chess as well as to further deepen
my knowledge of Machine Learning 

I want to build a general purpose algorithm that can be used across many disciplines, not just chess or other board games. I could try 
using something like a min/max function but despite chess having orders of magnitude less possible moves per state compared to a game like Go or Shogi 
it would still be highly inefficient and impractical to search through all possible scenarios on each iteration.
I'd want my function to remain as a decently competitive algorithm without becoming too resource intensive.
